# ToH CTF 2025

I was honoured to be a part of the organizing team for the ToH CTF 2025, that took place on July 19-20 2025. This folder contains the challenges I created for the competition. You can find the write-ups for these challenges in the `solution` folder. Folders structure is as follows:

```
.
├── challenge-name
│   ├── dist/
│   │   ├── docker-compose.yml
│   │   ├── ...
│   │   └── README.md
│   ├── solution/ 
│   │   ├── ...
│   │   ├── x.py
│   │   └── README.md
│   └── README.md
```
Where `dist/` and `README.md` represents the handout, the challenge files given during the competition, and `solution/` contains the write-up and exploit scripts for the challenge.

## Challenges

1. **Completely Dangerous**
2. **ToH Wedding**
