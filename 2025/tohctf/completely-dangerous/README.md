# Completely Dangerous

## Description
I am developing this app with a beautiful feature that allows users to color and choose their name and color. But... I believe something is not right.

NOTE: The bot uses a custom Firefox profile with saved credentials. For testing purposes, you will find fake credentials in the distributed sources. However, the remote server uses different credentials. Brute-forcing is not an intended solution. Your goal is to find a way to leak the credentials and retrieve the flag!

## Deployment

Use the `deploy/` folder for deployment

Use the `dist/` folder for distribution

Use `solution/x.py` for testing if solution works 
```
cd solution
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 x.py
```
